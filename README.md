# Automated-Web-Scraping-NLP-Data-Analysis-Pipeline

# Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project consists of two Python scripts that work together to perform data scraping and analysis with NLP processing. The final processed data is exported as an Excel (`.xlsx`) file. Notably, `Scraper.py` generates 148 text files containing the raw data, which are later processed by `Analyser.py`, applying NLP techniques and updating all metrics in the original Excel file.

## Project Structure

- **`Scraper.py`**  
  This script is responsible for retrieving data from specified online sources and outputs 148 text files containing the raw data.

- **`Analyser.py`**  
  This script reads the 148 text files, processes and analyzes the data using NLP techniques, and finally exports the results as an Excel (`.xlsx`) file.

- **Final Output File**  
  The processed data is saved as an Excel (`.xlsx`) file, conforming to the required output structure.

## Approach to the Solution

### 1. Data Scraping
- `Scraper.py` retrieves data from online sources using libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- The raw data is extracted, formatted, and saved into 148 text files.

### 2. Data Processing and NLP Analysis
- `Analyser.py` reads all 148 text files generated by the scraper.
- The script cleans and processes the data using `pandas` and applies NLP techniques such as tokenization, sentiment analysis, and text summarization using `NLTK` or `spaCy`.

### 3. Output Generation
- After processing, the script exports the final data to an Excel (`.xlsx`) file using `pandas.to_excel()`.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Setup Python Environment
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4 openpyxl nltk spacy
```

### 3. Run the Scripts

#### a. Run the Scraper
```bash
python Scraper.py
```
This will fetch data and generate the 148 text files.

#### b. Run the Analyser
```bash
python Analyser.py
```
This will process the text files, perform NLP analysis, and generate the final Excel (`.xlsx`) output.

#### c. Verify the Output
Ensure that the Excel file is generated in the project directory and adheres to the required output structure.
